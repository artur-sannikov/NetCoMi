## NetCoMi 1.0.3.9000 <img src="man/figures/NetCoMi_logo_800x400_300dpi.png" align="right" width="200" />

The features and bug fixes implemented in version 1.0.3.9000 are available on 
**develop branch** only.

### New features

* **renameTaxa()**: New function for renaming taxa in a taxonomic table. 
It comes with functionality for 
making unknown and unclassified taxa unique and substituting them by the next 
higher known taxonomic level, e.g., an unknown genus "g__" can automatically be 
renamed to "1_Streptococcaceae(F)". User-defined patterns determine the format 
of known and substituted names. Unknown names (e.g., NAs) and unclassified taxa 
can be handled separately. Duplicated names within one or more chosen ranks can 
also be made unique by numbering them consecutively.

* **editLabels()**: New function for editing node labels, i.e., shortening to a 
certain length and removing unwanted characters. It is used by NetCoMi's plot 
functions plot.microNetProps() and plot.diffnet().

* in `netCompare()`: The **adjusted Rand index** is also computed for the 
largest connected component (LCC). The summary method has been adapted.

* Argument **"testRand"** added to `netCompare()`. Performing a permutation 
test for the adjusted Rand index can now be disabled to save run time.

* **Graphlet-based network measures** implemented. NetCoMi contains two new 
exported functions **`calcGCM()`** and **`calcGCD()`** to compute the Graphlet 
Correlation Matrix (GCM) of a network and the Graphlet Correlation Distance 
(GCD) between two networks. 
Orbits for graphlets with up to four nodes are considered. 
Furthermore, the GCM is computed with `netAnalyze()` and the 
GCD with `netCompare()` (for the whole network and the largest connected 
component, respectively). Also the orbit counts are returned. The GCD is added 
to the summary for class `microNetComp` objects returned by `netCompare()`.

* Argument **"doPlot"** added to `plot.microNetProps()` to suppress the plot if 
only the return value is of interest. 

* New **"show"** arguments are added to the summary methods for class 
`microNetProps` and `microNetComp` objects. They specify which network 
properties should be printed in the summary. See the help pages of
`summary.microNetProps` and `summary.microNetComp()` for details.

* New zero replacement method **"pseudoZO"** available in `netConstruct()`. 
Instead of adding the desired pseudo count to the whole count matrix, it is 
added to zero counts only if `pseudoZO` is chosen. The behavior of "pseudo" 
(a further available method where a pseudo count is added to all counts) has not changed. 
Adding a pseudo count only to zeros preserves the ratios between non-zero 
counts, which is desirable. 

### Style

* The whole R code has been reformatted to follow general conventions.

* The element `"clustering_lcc"` as part of the `netAnalyze` output has changed 
to `"clusteringLCC"` to be in line with the remaining output. 

* Input argument checking of exported function has been revised. New functions 
`.checkArgsXxx()` are added to perform argument checking outside the main 
functions. 

* Non-exported functions have been renamed to follow general naming conventions, 
i.e. that of [Bioconductor](https://contributions.bioconductor.org/r-code.html):
    + Use camelCase for all functions.
    + Non-exported functions have prefix "."
    + The following functions have been renamed:

## NetCoMi 1.0.3 

This is a minor release with some bug fixes and changes in the documentation.

### Bug fixes 

* `netConstruct()` threw an error if the data had no row and/or column names, 
which is fixed.

* An edge list is added to the output of `netConstruct()` (issue [#41](https://github.com/stefpeschel/NetCoMi/issues/41)). See the 
help page for details.

* `SPRING`'s fast version of latent correlation computation (implemented in 
[mixedCCA](https://github.com/irinagain/mixedCCA)) is currently not available 
due to deprecation of the R package `chebpol`. The issue is fixed by setting 
the `netConstruct()` parameter `measurePar$Rmethod` internally to "original" if 
SPRING is used for association estimation.

* In `plot.microNetProps()`: The `xpd` parameter is changed to `NA` so that 
plotting outside the plot region is possible (useful for legends or additional
text).

* Labels in the network plot can now be suppressed by setting `labels = FALSE`
(issue [#43](https://github.com/stefpeschel/NetCoMi/issues/43))

* The `netCompare()` function threw an error if one of the permutation networks 
was empty, i.e. had no edges with weight different from zero (issue [#38](https://github.com/stefpeschel/NetCoMi/issues/38)), 
which is now fixed. 

* Fix issues [#29](https://github.com/stefpeschel/NetCoMi/issues/29) and  [#40](https://github.com/stefpeschel/NetCoMi/issues/40), where permutation tests 
did not terminate for small sample sizes. 
Now, if the possible number of permutations (resulting from the sample 
size) is smaller than that defined by the user, the function stops and returns 
an error. 

* Fix a bug in `diffnet()` (issue 
[#51](https://github.com/stefpeschel/NetCoMi/issues/51)), where colors in 
differential networks could not be changed.

* `diffnet()` threw an error if the `netConstruct()` argument `jointPrepro` was 
set to `TRUE`.


## NetCoMi 1.0.2

This release includes a range of new features and fixes known bugs and issues.

### New features

#### Improved installation process 

Packages that are optionally required in certain settings are not installed 
together with `NetCoMi` anymore. 
Instead, there is a new function `installNetCoMiPacks()` for installing the 
remaining packages. 
If not installed via `installNetCoMiPacks()`, the required package is installed
by the respective NetCoMi function when needed.

#### installNetCoMiPacks()

New function for  installing the R packages used in NetCoMi not listed as 
`dependencies` or `imports` in NetCoMi's description file.

#### netConstruct()

* New argument `matchDesign`: Implements matched-group (i.e. matched-pair) designs, 
which are used for permutation tests in `netCompare()` and `diffnet()`. `c(1,2)`, 
for instance, means that one sample in the first group is matched to two samples 
in the second group. If the argument is not `NULL`, the matched-group design is
kept when generating permuted data.

* New argument `jointPrepro`: Specifies whether two data sets (of group one and
two) should be preprocessed together. Preprocessing includes sample and taxa 
filtering, zero treatment, and normalization. Defaults to `TRUE` if `data` and 
`group` are given, and to `FALSE` if `data` and `data2` are given, which is 
similar to the behavior of `NetCoMi 1.0.1`. For dissimilarity networks, no joint 
preprocessing is possible. 

* `mclr(){SPRING}` is now available as normalization method.

* `clr{SpiecEasi}` is used for centered log-ratio transformation 
instead of `cenLR(){robCompositions}`.

* `"symBetaMode"` is accepted as list element of `measurePar`, which is passed to 
`symBeta(){SpiecEasi}`. Only needed for SpiecEasi or SPRING associations.

* The pseudocount (if `zeroMethod = "pseudo"`) may be freely specified. In 
v1.0.1, only unit pseudocounts were possible.

#### netAnalyze()

* Global network properties are now computed for the whole network as well as 
for the largest connected component (LCC). 
The summary of network properties now contains for the whole network only 
statistics that are not based on shortest paths (or, more generally, also 
meaningful for disconnected networks). 
For the LCC, all global properties available in NetCoMi are shown.

* New global network properties (see the docu of `netAnalyze()` for definitions):
  + Number of components (only whole network)
  + Relative LCC size (only LCC)
  + Positive edge percentage
  + Natural connectivity
  + Average dissimilarity (only meaningful for the LCC)
  + Average path length (only meaningful for the LCC)

* New argument `centrLCC`: Specifies whether to compute centralities only for 
the LCC. If `TRUE`, centrality values of disconnected components are zero.

* New argument `avDissIgnoreInf`: Indicates whether infinite values should be 
ignored in the average dissimilarity. If `FALSE`, infinities are set to 1.

* New argument `sPathAlgo`: Algorithm used for computing shortest paths

* New argument `sPathNorm`: Indicates whether shortest paths should be normalized
by average dissimilarity to improve interpretability.

* New argument `normNatConnect`: Indicates whether to normalize natural 
connectivity values.

* New argument `weightClustCoef`: Specifies the algorithm used for computing the
global clustering coefficient. If `FALSE`, `transitivity(){igraph}` with 
`type = "global"` is used (similar to `NetCoMi 1.0.1`). If `TRUE`, the local
clustering coefficient is computed using `transitivity(){igraph}` with 
`type = "barrat"`. The global clustering coefficient is then the arithmetic 
mean of local values.

* Argument `connect` has been changed to `connectivity`.

* Documentation extended by definitions of network properties.

#### summary.microNetProps()

* New argument `clusterLCC`: Indicates whether clusters should be shown for the
whole network or only for the LCC.

* The `print` method for `summary.microNetProps` was completely revised.

#### plot.microNetProps()

* All normalization methods available for network construction can now be used
for scaling node sizes (argument `nodeSize`).

* New argument `normPar`: Optional parameters used for normalization.

* Usage of `colorVec` changed: Node colors can now be set separately in both 
groups (`colorVec` can be a single vector or a list with two vectors). Usage
depends on `nodeColor` (see docu of `colorVec`).

* New argument `sameFeatCol`: If `nodeColor = "feature"` and `colorVec` is not 
given, `sameFeatCol` indicates whether same features should have same colors in
both groups. 

* Argument `colorNegAsso` has been renamed to `negDiffCol`. Using the old name
leads to a warning.

* New functionality for using the same layout in both groups (if two networks
are plotted). In addition to computing the layout for one group and adopting it 
for the other group, a union of both layout can be computed and used in both
groups so that nodes are placed as optimal as possible equally for both networks. 
This option is applied via `sameLayout = TRUE` and `layoutGroup = "union"`.
Many thanks to [Christian L. Müller](https://github.com/muellsen?tab=followers) 
and [Alice Sommer](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/people/alice-sommer) for providing 
the idea and R code for this new feature!

#### netCompare()

* New arguments for storing association and count matrices of the permuted data
into an external file:
  + `fileLoadAssoPerm`
  + `fileLoadCountsPerm`
  + `storeAssoPerm`
  + `fileStoreAssoPerm`
  + `storeCountsPerm`
  + `fileStoreCountsPerm`
  
* New argument `returnPermProps`: If `TRUE`, global network properties and the
respective absolute group differences of the permuted data are returned.

* New argument `returnPermCentr`: If `TRUE`, the computed centrality values 
and the respective absolute group differences of the permuted data are returned 
as list with a matrix for each centrality measure.

* The arguments `assoPerm` and `dissPerm` are still existent for compatibility 
with `NetCoMi 1.0.1` but the former elements `assoPerm` and `dissPerm` are not
returned anymore (matrices are stored in an external file instead).
  
#### createAssoPerm()

New function for creating association/dissimilarity matrices for permuted count 
data. The stored count or association/dissimilarity matrices can then be passed 
to `netCompare()` or `diffnet()` to decrease runtime. The function also 
allows to generate a matrix permuted group labels without computing associations.
Using this matrix, `createAssoPerm()` furthermore allows to estimate the 
permutation associations/dissimilarities in blocks 
(by passing only a subset of the permuted group matrix to `createAssoPerm()`).

#### summary.microNetComp()

Summary method has been adapted to the new network properties (analogous to the 
summary of `microNetProps` objects, which are returned from `netAnalyze()`)

#### diffnet()
* New arguments for storing association and count matrices of the permuted data
into an external file:
  + `fileLoadAssoPerm`
  + `fileLoadCountsPerm`
  + `storeAssoPerm`
  + `fileStoreAssoPerm`
  + `storeCountsPerm`
  + `fileStoreCountsPerm`
  
* The argument `assoPerm` is still existent for compatibility with `NetCoMi 1.0.1` 
but the former element `assoPerm` is not returned anymore (matrices are 
stored in an external file instead).

* Changed output: For permutation tests and Fisher's z-test, a vector and matrix
with p-values and the corresponding matrix with group differences are returned 
for both with and without multiple testing adjustment.

* Documentation has been revised.

#### plot.diffnet()

* New argument `adjusted`: Indicates whether the adjacency matrix (matrix with
group differences) based on adjusted or unadjusted p-values should be plotted.

* New argument `legendPos` for positioning the legend.

* New argument `legendArgs` for specifying further arguments passed to `legend`.

#### colToTransp()
* The function is now exported and its name has changed from `col_to_transp()` 
to `colToTransp()`. The function expects a color vector as input and adds 
transparency to each color.


### Bug fixes

The major issues fixed in this release are:

* The following error is solved: `Error in update.list(...): argument "new" is 
missing`. The error was caused by a conflict between `SpiecEasi` and 
`metagenomeSeq`, in particular by `gplot` as a dependency of `metagenomeSeq`. 
A former version of `gplot` was dependend on `gdata`, which caused the conflict. 
So, please update `gplot` and remove the package `gdata` to fix the error. 

* `sparcc()` from SpiecEasi package is now used for estimating SparCC associations.
For some users, NetCoMi's `Rccp` implementation of SparCC caused errors when 
installing NetCoMi. If these are fixed, the Rcpp implementation will 
be included again, so that users can decide between the two SparCC versions. 

* VST transformations are now computed correctly.

* Error when plotting two networks, where one network is empty, has been fixed.
