\title{Summary Method for Objects of Class netProps}
\usage{
\method{summary}{microNetComp}(
  object,
  groupNames = NULL,
  pAdjust = TRUE,
  showCentr = "all",
  numbTaxa = 10L,
  ...
)

\method{print}{summary.microNetComp}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{object of class \code{netProps} inheriting from a call to
\code{\link{netCompare}}.}

\item{groupNames}{character vector with two elements giving the group names
corresponding to the two networks. If \code{NULL}, the names are adopted
from \code{object}}

\item{pAdjust}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the permutation p-values adjusted for
multiple testing are shown.}

\item{showCentr}{character vector indicating for which centrality measures
the results (values for both groups, difference and p-values resulting from
permutation tests) shall be printed. Possible values are "all", "degree",
"betweenness", "closeness", "eigenvector" and "none".}

\item{numbTaxa}{integer indicating for how much taxa the centrality
values shall be printed. Defaults to 10 which means that the first 10 taxa
with highest absolute group difference of the specific centrality
measure are shown.}

\item{...}{not used}

\item{x}{object of class \code{summary.microNetComp} inheriting from a call
to \code{\link{summary.microNetComp}}.}
}
\description{
The main results returned from \code{\link{netCompare}} are
  printed in a well-arranged format.
