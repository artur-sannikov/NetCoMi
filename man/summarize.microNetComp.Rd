\usage{
\method{summary}{microNetComp}(
  object,
  groupNames = NULL,
  showRand = TRUE,
  showCentr = "all",
  pAdjust = TRUE,
  numbNodes = 10L,
  digits = 3L,
  digitsPval = 6L,
  ...

\method{print}{summary.microNetComp}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{object of class \code{microNetComp} returned by 
\code{\link{netCompare}}.}

\item{groupNames}{character vector with two elements giving the group names
for the two networks. If \code{NULL}, the names are adopted
from \code{object}}

\item{showCentr}{character vector indicating which centrality measures
should be included in the summary. Possible values are "all", "degree",
"betweenness", "closeness", "eigenvector" and "none".}

\item{pAdjust}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the permutation p-values adjusted for
multiple testing are shown.}

\item{numbNodes}{integer indicating for how many nodes the centrality
values shall be printed. Defaults to 10 meaning that the first 10 taxa
with highest absolute group difference of the specific centrality
measure are shown.}

\item{digits}{integer giving the number of decimal places to which the 
results are rounded. Defaults to 3L.}

\item{digitsPval}{integer giving the number of decimal places to which the 
p-values are rounded. Defaults to 6L.}

\item{...}{not used}

\item{x}{object of class \code{summary.microNetComp} (returned by 
to \code{\link{summary.microNetComp}}).}
}
\description{
The main results returned by \code{\link{netCompare}} are
  printed in a well-arranged format.
